# Migrate to calmPress

This is a **WordPress plugin** that migrates a WordPress installation to
[calmPress](https://calmpress.org).

## Usage

1. Install the downloaded zip file from within the WordPress dashboard
   ("Plugins" -> "Add New" -> "Upload Plugin").
2. Activate this plugin ("Migrate to calmPress") after it is installed.
5. Go to the calmPress Migration page by clicking the **Migrate** link in
   this plugin's table row, or at **Tools -> Migrate to calmPress**.
6. If all the checks pass, press the **Migrate this site to calmPress now!**
   button. If not, you'll probably need to upgrade WordPress or PHP.
7. The migration process may take a few minutes so be patient 🙂
8. When the process is finished, you should see the ClassicPress About screen.
   At this point it is safe to delete the “Migrate to calmPress” plugin.
9. You may be prompted to upgrade ClassicPress immediately after switching from
   WordPress.  This is normal, and it is safe to upgrade.
